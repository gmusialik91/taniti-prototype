## Project Overview

The Taniti Tourism prototype demonstrates user-centered design principles through a responsive, accessible website.  
It presents information about visiting Taniti and includes consistent navigation, page layout, and design elements.  
The purpose of this prototype is to show structure and usability, not final visual design or functionality.
